        Lumi is an nano framework to convert your python functions into a REST API without any extra headache.
        
        * This library is created by taking the concept of **RPC** and blended with **REST API** specs. 
        * We need to just register the function and it will be available as a REST API. 
        * Web-server written with **Gunicorn**
        * Local development server provided for rapid development and prototyping.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ```bash
        pip install lumi
        ```
        
        ## Function <--> API mapping

        ## How to use 🤔
        
        Let's create a simple function to add two numbers.
        
        ```python
        def add(a, b):
            return a + b
        
        def substract(a, b):
            return a - b
        ```
        
        Now, we want to expose this function as a REST API. We can do this by registering the function with Lumi.
        
        ```python
        # app.py
        
        from lumi import Lumi
        
        app = Lumi()
        
        app.register(add) # Registering the function
        app.register(substract)
        
        app.runServer(host="127.0.0.1", port=8080)
        ```
        
        Noice 🎉🎉  API has been generated
        
        Run the sever by
        ```
        python app.py
        ```
        You are going to see this in your terminal 
        ```

        [2022-11-24 17:32:08 +0530] [10500] [INFO] Booting worker with pid: 10500
        ```
        
        Congratulations 👏. Our Server is online. 
        
        
        The above code will generate a REST API with the following details.
        
        - Endpoint : `127.0.0.1:8080`
        - Route : `/add`
        - Method : `POST`
        - Sample Request Body : `{"a": 1, "b": 2}`
        
        Let's run the API and test it.
        
        ```curl
        curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"a": 1, "b": 2}' http://127.0.0.1:8080/add
        ```
        
        Output
        
        ```json
        {
            "exit_code": 0, 
            "status_code": 200, 
            "result": 3, 
            "error": ""
        }
        ```
        
        
        Now you may think, the function name will be always same as the route. But, you can change the route by passing the route parameter.
        
        ```python
        app.register(add, route="/addition")
        ```
        
        ## Status Codes
        
        | Status Code | Description |
        | --- | --- |
        | 200 | Request successfully executed and No Error happened during function execution |
        | 500 | Request was received but there was an error during function execution |
        | 400 | Bad Request (Possible Reason - The required parameters for the function has not provided) |
        | 405 | Method Not Allowed (Lumi only supports **POST** request) |
        | 404 | The route has no function associated with that |
        
        
        ## Exit Codes
        | Exit Code | Description |
        | --- | --- |
        | 0 | No Error |
        | 1 | Error |
        
        > Note : If the function has some error , you can expect the exit code to be 1 and the error message in the response.
        
        ## Task Lists
        - [x] Base System
        - [x] Add support for default parameters that is provided in the function
        - [ ] Add authentication middleware support
        - [ ] Support nested routing of urls
        - [ ] Add support for object serialization and deserialization based on argument types of function
